Power Supply
------------

  * Make V1P5 jumper selectable between 1V5A (PowerBoard LDO) and V1P5_INT
    (SmartFusion internal LDO)
  * VBAT -> Li-Ion coin cell


Programming
-----------

JTAG programmability via JTAG connector and FlashPro4
JTAG programmability via PowerBoard
MSS self-programmability via MainBoard SD card (SPI)
MSS self-programmability via PowerBoard MCU (SPI)

NOTE: PC14 and PC15 might be needed for the (32kHz) LSE oscillator

Misc
----

  * External memory
    - for recording (CY62167EV30 or similar, or a pSRAM)
	- self-reconfiguration (size!)

  * External clock syncnronization
    - Daisy chain or similar topology
	- SMA connectors

Interfaces
----------

Sensor board

  * Wake-on radio signal
  * Diagnostic interface (I2C)
    - presence
	- ID
	- self diagnostic test
	- sensor calibration
	- etc.

Power Supply board

  * Diagnostic interface (I2C)
	- ID
	- battery health
	- etc.

  * Streaming interface (SPI)
    - RAW streaming through USB
	- Logging on Power Supply board SD card
	- Communication bridge to USB

  * Programmer interface
    - GPIO or other signals should be dedicated as a JTAG (or SWD) interface

Board
-----

  * Account for an RJ45 connector on the Power Supply Board (Do not place any
    components on the bottom in that area)

  * Use 71439-2164 type receptacles to keep at least 13mm distance between the
    Power Supply and the Main board
