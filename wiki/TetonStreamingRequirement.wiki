|| *_SOF_* || *SEQ* || *I,,0,,* || *Q,,0,,* || ... || *I,,N-1,,* || *Q,,N-1,,* ||

*_SOF_*: Start of frame delimiter (TBD: check if this is needed). Can be used to:

 * synchronize frames (helps to find SEQ)

*SEQ*: 16-bit unsigned sequence number of the _first sample_ in the packet. Can be used to:

 * synchronize frames
 * detect and count sample drops

*I,,x,,,Q,,x,,*: 16-bit unsigned (TBD: signed or unsigned) I and Q sample pairs

*N*: Packet payload length in samples. N = 256. (TBD: value of N)
