#labels Phase-Requirements
= Power Supply =

 * The FPGA should use the power rails from the Power Board
 * The FPGA may have a button-battery for RTC
 * Should assume 1.8 V on the reserved power rail and bypass it to the sensor board


= Clock Subsystem =

 * External clock synchronization Multiple nodes should be able to synchronize their FPGA clock(s) to each other
 * A TCVCXO should be available to provide clock for the FPGA
 * A ~50-100 MHz crystal oscillator should be available for the FPGA
 * RTC

= Programmer logic =

 * The FPGA and the uC should be programmable by the PowerBoard
 * The FPGA and the uC should be programmable directly via JTAG
 * The above two should not conflict (e.g. multiplexer should be used)

= Reset Logic =

 * The PowerBoard should be able to reset the FPGA
 * The FPGA should have an external reset (e.g. push-button or jumper)

= Wake-up Logic =

 * The FPGA/uC should be able to weak up on an external signal (e.g. consider connecting it to a pin with analog comparator or Flash*Freeze-like functionality)

= Interfaces =

== Analog Front-End / Sensor Board ==

 * Should support 4 ADCs with at least 1 MSPS for sensor hookup
 * Should have a ADC with at least 4 MSPS (?) for RF RX
 * Should have a DAC with at least 4 MSPS for RF TX
 * The RF RX and sensor ADCs may be shared
 * The ADCs and DAC(s) should use differential analog signals
 * ADCs and DACs should have power down mode
 * ADCs and DACs should have adjustable clock rate (power consumption)
 * We might need to consider the UMich (Prabal) approach (high speed ADC/DAC to be used with integrated WiFi RF frontend)
 * Consider adding external DDC(s) and DUC(s)

Note: The maximum SmartFusion processable sampling rate should be determined prior to selecting the ADCs and DAC(s).


= Connectors =

 * External clock sync connector
