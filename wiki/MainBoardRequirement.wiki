#labels Phase-Requirements

= Power Supply =

The FPGA should use the power rails from the Power Board
The FPGA may have a button-battery for RTC


= Clock Subsystem =

 * External clock synchronization Multiple nodes should be able to synchronize their FPGA clock(s) to each other
 * A TCVCXO should be available to provide clock for the FPGA
 * A ~50-100 MHz crystal oscillator should be available for the FPGA
 * RTC


= Reset Logic =


= Interfaces =

== Analog Front-End / Sensor Board ==

 * Should support 4 ADCs with at least 1 MSPS for sensor hookup
 * Should have a ADC with at least 4 MSPS (?) for RF RX
 * Should have a DAC with at least 4 MSPS for RF TX
 * The RF RX and sensor ADCs may be shared
 * The ADCs and DAC(s) should use differential analog signals

Note: The maximum SmartFusion processable sampling rate should be determined prior to selecting the ADCs and DAC(s).


= Connectors =

External clock sync connector
