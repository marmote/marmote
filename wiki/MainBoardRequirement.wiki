= Interfaces =

== Power Supply ==

The FPGA should use the power rails from the Power Board
The FPGA may have a button-battery for RTC

== Analog Front-End / Sensor Board ==

Should support 4 ADCs with at least 1 MSPS for sensor hookup
Should have a ADC with at least 4 MSPS (?) for RF RX
Should have a DAC with at least 4 MSPS for RF TX
The ADCs should use differential analog signals

Note: The maximum SmartFusion processable sampling rate should be determined prior to selecting the ADCs and DAC(s).

== Connectors ==

External clock sync connector

= Functionality =

== Clock Subsystem ==

 * External clock synchronization Multiple nodes should be able to synchronize their FPGA clock(s) to each other
 * A TCVCXO should be available to provide clock for the FPGA
 * A ~50-100 MHz crystal oscillator should be available for the FPGA
 * RTC
