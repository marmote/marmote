= Measurement setup =

== Receiver ==

USRP1 with an RFX2400 daughterboard tuned to 2.40495 GHz (all cases).

== Transmitter ==

=== 1. No transmitter (receiver noise level) ===

=== 3. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *FOX924 20 MHz TCXO* ===

The CMOS output of the TCXO is fed to the SmartFusion PLL directly. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

=== 4. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *precision 20 MHz TCXO* ===
The clipped sine output of the TCXO is fed to the MAX2830 and then the SmartFusion PLL. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

=== 5. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *precision 26 MHz TCXO* ===
The clipped sine output of the TCXO is fed to the MAX2830 and then the SmartFusion PLL. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

= Remarks =
 
 * In all cases the signal seems to be approximately 40dBc clean
