#summary Measurement results related to the TCXO on the Joshua radio front-end.
#labels Phase-Support,Phase-QA

= Measurement setup =

== Receiver ==

USRP1 with an RFX2400 daughterboard tuned to 2.40495 GHz (all cases).

== Transmitter ==

=== 1. No transmitter (receiver noise level) ===

=== 2. USRP1 transmitting at 2.405 GHz ===

=== 3. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *FOX924 20 MHz TCXO* ===

The CMOS output of the TCXO is fed to the SmartFusion PLL directly. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

=== 4. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *precision 20 MHz TCXO* ===
The clipped sine output of the TCXO is fed to the MAX2830 and then the SmartFusion PLL. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

=== 5. Marmote transmitting at 2.405 GHz with *precision 26 MHz TCXO* ===
The clipped sine output of the TCXO is fed to the MAX2830 and then the SmartFusion PLL. The 20 MHz PLL output drives the external AFEs.

= Remarks =
 
 * In all cases the signal seems approximately 40dBc clean
 * Looking at the (precision) TCXO output past the AC coupling capacitor using an oscilloscope, the signal looked 'somewhat noisy'
