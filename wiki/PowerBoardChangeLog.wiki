#summary Log of changes on the Power Supply Board between different revisions
#labels Phase-Support,Phase-Deploy

= From Rev A to Rev B =

 # The !CHRG pin of the LTC4085 is connected to a microcontroller GPIO (PB9) instead of an external LED (LED0)
 # LED0 has been removed
 # The !PWRGD pin of the LTC4361 is NOT connected to a microcontroller GPIO (PB9) anymore
 # Power rail measurements have changed
   * Current on VSUP (individually) and on !D3V3_STM is not measured anymore
   * Current and voltage on VSUP_R (source of all rails) is measured instead
   * The current sense - ADC connections have been completely reorganized
 # The LTC2942-1 battery gauge !AL/CC pin is connected to GPIO PB4 instead of PB5
 # The 64-pin mezzanine connector has been replaced with a 84-pin one
 # The mezzanine connector pinous has been reorganized
   * The PB5 GPIO line on the connector has been replaced with PB4 (with SMBus alter functionality)
 # JTAG DNP resistors have been removed, only SWD is available
 # Added pull-up resistor to the USBDP line (still not the best solution)
 # Reset jumper has been replaced with a push button
 # BOOT0 selector jumper has been replaced with a slide switch
