#summary Requirement for the Power Supply Board
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Functional =

 * Should be able to identify itself to the host (USB) and the other boards (I^2^C)

== Power Rails ==

 * Should provide 1.5 V power rail for the FPGA
 * Should provide 3.3 V power rail for the FPGA
 * May provide 1.8 V power rail for the SRAM, radio chip and/or other peripherals


== Programmer Logic ==

 * Must be able to program the FPGA on the MainBoard
 * Must be able to receive bitstream file through USB
  ** May provide a mass-storage-like interface
 * Should be able to retrieve bitstream file from the SD card
 * Must support an open bitstream file format


== Data acquisition ==

 * Must be able to read data samples from the FPGA
 * Should be able to read from and write to the SD card
 * Must be able to transfer data samples back through USB
  ** Should provide an audio class interface for slower, continuous streaming
  ** Should provide bulk transfer mode to retrieve buffered (from external memory on the MainBoard)

= Software =

_Note: The "Software" section below should go somewhere else._

 * The software should utilize a simple OS

 * The OS should
  ** support both ST32 and SmartFusion ARM Cortex M3
  ** support CMSIS HAL
  ** have no licensing issues
  ** come with decent IDE and debug tools (Eclipse preferred)
  ** be easy to use with SPI/FAT for the SD card (nice to have)
  ** be easy to use with USB
