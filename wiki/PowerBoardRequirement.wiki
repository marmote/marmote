#labels Phase-Requirements
= General =

 * Should be able to identify itself to the host (USB) and the other boards (I^2^C)

= Power Rails =

 * Should provide 1.5 V power rail for the FPGA
 * Should provide 3.3 V power rail for the FPGA
 * May provide 1.8 V power rail for the SRAM, radio chip and/or other peripherals


= Programmer Logic =

 * Must be able to program the FPGA on the MainBoard
 * Must be able to receive bitstream file through USB
 ** May provide a mass-storage-like interface
 * Should be able to retrieve bitstream file from the SD card
 * Must support an open bitstream file format


= Data acquisition =

 * Must be able to read data samples from the FPGA
 * Should be able to read from and write to the SD card
 * Must be able to transfer data samples back through USB
 ** Should provide an audio class interface for slower, continuous streaming
 ** Should provide bulk transfer mode to retrieve buffered (from external memory on the MainBoard)
