#summary Errata and Design Notes for Power Supply Board Rev A and Rev B
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-QA

= Rev B =

== Errata ==

 * DONE - Silkscreen labels !D1V5 and !D3V3 are swapped
 * DONE - VBUS measurement point not assembled
 * DONE - SW2 name missing, needs caption (silk screen)
 * DONE - Power input needs description (silk screen)

== Notes ==

 * Reset push button is easier to handle a looks better than the jumper
 * BOOT select switch is easier to handle a looks better than the jumper

----

= Rev A =

== Errata ==

 * USB D+ line pull-up resistor R,,PU,, seems to be missing
 * Battery gauge I^2^C lines may get stuck if not powered up properly

== Notes ==

 * Via test points on important lines are useful
 * Reset jumper seems to be valuable (reset test)
 * Temporary MCO connection seems to be useful (R=0)
 * A push button might have been more useful than a jumper for NRST
 * TRACESWO would have been useful to be connected to the board-to-board connector as a GPIO (it's fault tolerant and has no special limitations)
 * Test points (especially GNDs) would be more useful on the side of the board
 * USB D+ line pull-up resistor R,,PU,, seems to be missing
 * PWRGD seems to be useless at first sight, consider connecting the GPIO pin to CHRG in Rev B
 * The 64-pin mezzanine connector through-hole drills make the use of a larger pin count connector for the upper layers complicated (e.g. consider replacing it with the same connector used on the top level)
