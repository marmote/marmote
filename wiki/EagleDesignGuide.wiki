#summary EAGLE Design Guide.
#labels Phase-Implementation

The Marmote project uses a multi-board platform. The printed circuit boards (PCBs) are created in [http://www.cadsoftusa.com/ CadSoft EAGLE] according the following rules:

= Library Components =

== Package ==

  # Create new package (package names should come from the datasheet or follow standard naming, e.g. IPC)
  # Set the grid based on the pin pitch of the device
  # Set pad dimensions and place the pads on the top layer (the roundness can be changed later with the DRC)
  # Make sure that the names of the pads are in order (1, 2, etc.)
  # Draw essential information (pin,,1,, designator) on tPlace using 8 mil or 4 mil thickness (Do not cover areas on the silkscreen that are to be soldered!)
  # Draw additional information on tDocu (not on silkscreen)
  # Place '>NAME' label on tNames using proportional font, 16 mil height, 8% width (will not be on silkscreen, but assembly drawing)
  #Place '>VALUE' label on tValues using vector font, 16 mil height, 8% width (will not be on silkscreen)
  # OPTIONAL layers:
    * Holes:       mounting holes
    *tRestrict: define area (RECT) without tracks (copper), e.g. around mounting holes, underneath metalic components, etc.
    *tKeepout:  define area (RECT) as big as the physical component (prevent overlapping components)
  # Add description:

}}}

== Symbol ==

  # Create new symbol (symbol name can be the same as device/part name)
  # Use 100 mil grid
  # Place pins: length short, visible both, function as desired
|| *Name* || *Description* || *ERC* ||
|| NC  || Not connected || A not connected pin ||
|| In || Input || A net connected to this pin and not only In pins connected to this net ||
|| Out || Output || Not only Out pins connected to the net, no Sup or OC pin at the same net ||
|| I/O || Input/output || No checks ||
|| OC  || Open Collector or Open Drain || No Out pin at the same net ||
|| Hiz || High impedance output || No checks ||
|| Pas || Passive (resistors, etc.) || No checks ||
|| Pwr || Power pin (power supply input) || A Sup pin set for this net ||
|| Sup || Power supply output for ground and supply symbols || ? ||

  # Add pin names    
  # Use WIRE on the Symbols layer to draw circuit symbol
  # Place '>NAME' label on Names using proportional font, 70 mil height, 10% width
  # Place '>VALUE' label on Values using proportional font, 70 mil height, 10% width

== Device ==

  # Create new device (same as device/part name)
  # Add symbol
  # Make sure Addlevel=Next and a Swaplevel=0 (unless...)
  # Select package and SPECIFY VARIANT NAME (will become part name suffix). 
  # OPTIONAL: you can specify technologies (per variants). These will become part of the part number (no other effect)
  # Connect pins and pads
  # Specify prefix (U for ICs, R, C, L, B (beads), D (diodes), X (quartz), J (connectors), JP (jumpers), TP (test points))
  # Value
   * editable: ON (resistors, capacitors, inductors) or 
   * non-editable: OFF(part name + tech name will be the value)
  # Add descritpion:

|| very large labels || inverse text with bold fonts and capitals (looks nice) ||
