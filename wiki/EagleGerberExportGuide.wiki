= Exporting Assembly Drawings =

When printing the board assembly layout into PDF, include the following layers:

== Top view ==
{{{
  * tPlace
  * tNames
  * tDocu
  * tStop
  * Pads
  * Vias
}}}
_Note: Top side silk screen texts and graphics are assumed to reside in the {{{tPlace}}} layer._

== Bottom view ==
{{{
  * bPlace
  * bNames
  * bDocu
  * bStop
  * Pads
  * Vias
}}}
_Note: Bottom side silk screen texts and graphics are assumed to reside in the {{{bPlace}}} layer._

Either combine the two PDFs into `<ProjectName>_Asy.pdf`, or simply name them `<ProjectName>_AsyT.pdf` and `<ProjectName>_AsyB.pdf` respectively.
