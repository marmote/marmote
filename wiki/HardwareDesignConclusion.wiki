= Power Board =

 * Via test points on important lines are useful
 * Reset jumper seems to be valuable (reset test)
 * Temporary MCO connection seems to be useful (R=0)
 * A push button might have been more useful than a jumper for NRST
 * TRACESWO would have been useful to be connected to the board-to-board connector as a GPIO (it's fault tolerant and has no special limitations)
 * Test points (especially GNDs) would be more useful on the side of the board
 * USB D+ line pull-up resistor R,,PU,, seems to be missing
 * PWRGD seems to be useless at first sight, consider connecting the GPIO pin to CHRG in Rev B
 * The 64-pin mezzanine connector through-hole drills make the use of a larger pin count connector for the upper layers complicated (e.g. consider replacing it with the same connector used on the top level)
