#summary A short guide on how to use Synphony HLS code generation for the Marmote platform.
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Deploy,Phase-Support

= Requirements =

 * Libero SoC 10 with license (free)
 * Synphony Model Compiler AE with license (free)

 * Matlab 2011b+ and Simulink with licenses for
  * Fixed-point Toolbox
  * Communication systems toolbox

= Set up =

 # Download and install Libero SoC and Synphony Model Compiler from http://www.actel.com/download/default.aspx
 # Download, install and run the necessary license manager daemon from http://www.actel.com/products/software/libero/licensing.aspx#daemons
   # Follow the instructions described in the email with the license
   # Start the daemon prior to launching Matlab
 # Create a Simulink model using the Synplify Model Compiler blockset
 # Simulate and generate HDL code for the model
 # Add the <synphony_top_module.vhd> and {{{SynLib.vhd}}} to the Libero project
 # Create a library 'shlslib' in Libero and add {{{SynLib.vhd}}} to it
 # Follow the regular Libero design flow
  # Simulate the HDL project using ModelSim
  # Synthesize the design
  # etc.
