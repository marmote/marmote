 * External TCXO is connected to MAX2830 XTAL pin (28) instead of CTUNE pin (29) *(fixed)*
 * Baseband single-ended to differential conversion maps approximately from single-ended [0 to 0.6V] to differential [0 to -0.5V] (instead of from single-ended [0 to 3.3V] to differential [-0.5V to +0.5V] (confirm whether this is what we want)
 * TCXO power supply digital, ground analog *(fixed)*
 * Mark for 1. pin for baluns not visible enough *(fixed)*
 * C105, C106 names covered by vias in documentation *(fixed)*
 * Consider adding a testpoint to the MAX2830 tune pin (similarly to TPTUNE on the MAX2830EVKIT)
 * Add (via) test points for the pins such as CLKOUT, LD)
