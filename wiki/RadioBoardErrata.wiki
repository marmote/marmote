== Errata ==

 * External TCXO is connected to MAX2830 XTAL pin (28) instead of CTUNE pin (29)
 * Not really a showstopper - Baseband single-ended to differential conversion maps approximately from single-ended [0 to 0.6V] to differential [0 to -0.5V] (instead of from single-ended [0 to 3.3V] to differential [-0.5V to +0.5V]
 * TCXO power supply digital, ground analog
 * DONE - Mark for 1. pin for baluns not visible enough
 * DONE - C105, C106 names covered by vias in documentation

== Notes ==

 * Via test points for potential test pins (clock out, lock detect) would have been useful
