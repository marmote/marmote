#summary Errata for the "Teton" Main Board Rev A
#labels Phase-Support

= Major issues =

  * PWRSAV is incorrectly connected (connected to nothing instead of VBUS)
   ** _Library issue: VBUS pin is called VBAT_
  * RJ-45 connector magnetic topology seems to be incorrect
  * Ethernet PHY R,,bias,, resistor value is 4.87 Ohm instead of 4.87 kOhm (BOM typo)


= Minor issues =

  * 'USB' silkscreen label next to a D3V3 test point is distracting
  * RJ45 silkscreen-footprint is larger than the actual device
  * The right-angle push buttons could be slightly (1 mm) closer to the board edge
  * The right-angle LEDs could be slightly (1 mm) closer to the board edge
  * The 50 MHz ETH OSC pins are inaccessible
  * The programmer is hard to connect when the board is stacked

  * Further scope accessible FPGA I/O pins (test points) would be useful (_Note: The low pin count of the current FBGA256 package did not make this possible_)
