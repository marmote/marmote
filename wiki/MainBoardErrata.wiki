#summary Errata for the "Teton" Main Board Rev A
#labels Phase-Support

= Rev B =

== Minor issues ==

  * Only 4 DGND pins remained on mezzanine connector (2 of the former 6 DGNDs became I/O pins)

= Rev A =

== Major issues ==

  * PWRSAV is incorrectly connected (connected to nothing instead of VBUS) *(fixed)*
   ** _Library issue: VBUS pin is called VBAT_
  * RJ-45 connector magnetic topology seems to be incorrect *(fixed)*
  * Ethernet PHY R,,bias,, resistor value is 4.87 Ohm instead of 4.87 kOhm (BOM typo) *(fixed)*
  * ~~Consider swapping the SPI0 MISO and MOSI lines if the SmartFusion is to be used as a slave peripheral~~
  * Component R14 is not supposed to be populated (BOM file error) *(fixed)*
  * R7 and C5 components are labeled incorrectly (swapped) in the assembly drawing *(fixed)*


== Minor issues ==

  * 'USB' silkscreen label next to a D3V3 test point is misleading *(fixed)*
  * RJ45 silkscreen-footprint is larger than the actual device *(fixed)*
  * The right-angle push buttons could be slightly (1 mm) closer to the board edge
  * The right-angle LEDs could be slightly (1 mm) closer to the board edge
  * The 50 MHz ETH OSC pins are inaccessible *(fixed)*
  * The programmer is hard to connect when the board is stacked

  * Further scope accessible FPGA I/O pins (test points) would be useful (_Note: The low pin count of the current FBGA256 package did not make this possible_)
