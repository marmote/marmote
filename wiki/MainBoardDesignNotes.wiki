== Priorities ==

Throughout the design of the SmartFusion FPGA-based Main Board the priorities were the following:

  # External Analog Front-End (highest)
  # USB streaming interface
  # SmartFusion Analog Front-End and Ethernet

==  Known possible issues ==

 * The external AFE and USB digital data buses should have series resistors to minimize the digital transient currents. Due to board space limitations, these resistors were omitted.

 * The external AFE and USB were given priority over the SmartFusion AFE, thus the signals of the latter one might be noisy due to routing limitations.
