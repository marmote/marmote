#labels Phase-Requirements
= Requirement =

 * May support UWB time-sync/localization
 * Should have a PLL to lock-on a carrier signal
 * Should have a fine tunable LO (say in < 50 Hz steps)
 * Should operate in the 433 MHz and/or 2.4 GHz band

= Clocking =

 * LO clocks should be derived from a temperature compensated voltage controlled crystal oscillator (TCVCXO) driven source

= Analog front-end =

 * Consider adding a second RF front-end IC and antenna if ADCs and DACs are already present (at least at footprint-level)

= Test points =

 * Analog baseband waveform feed in (signal generator) and signal out (oscilloscope) test point (e.g. right after the DAC/ADC)
 * Analog baseband signal loop-back option
 * Analog RF signal loopback option (might be trivial)

= Misc = 

 * May have a microphone and a speaker (footprint)
