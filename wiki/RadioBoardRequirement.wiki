#summary Requirement and design considerations for Radio Front-End Board
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Rev B =

_Note: Only changes compared to Rev A and non-implemented functions are listed here._

 * Power-down mode for 20 MHz oscillator
 * VCTCXO (controlled from AFE DAC) instead of simple TCXO
 * Second antenna in the same band for MIMO applications

 * Analog baseband filter
  * Should be removable
  * TBD cut-off frequency
  * Candidate ICs ([http://www.linear.com/product/LTC6602 LTC6602])
 * Clock synchronization between boards (optional) or 1PPS input and output
 * The whole board should be powered down by default (including the TCXO)
 

= Rev A =

= Functional =

 * May support UWB time-sync/localization
 * Should have a PLL to lock-on a carrier signal
 * Should have a fine tunable LO (say in < 50 Hz steps)
 * Should operate in the 433 MHz and/or 2.4 GHz band

= Clocking =

 * LO clocks should be derived from a temperature compensated voltage controlled crystal oscillator (TCVCXO) driven source
 * Should have an on-board TCXO (for cases the bottom board is unable to provide it)
 * Must be able to use a clock sourced from the MainBoard through the mezzanine connector
 * Should be able to switch between the above two (either by a jumper or a digital switch)

= Analog front-end =

 * Consider adding a second RF front-end IC and antenna if ADCs and DACs are already present (at least at footprint-level)
 * Consider connecting the RSSI signal to both the SF ADC and a high-precision ADC

= Test points =

 * Analog baseband waveform feed in (signal generator) and signal out (oscilloscope) test point (e.g. right after the DAC/ADC)
  * Consider adding this functionality to the Inspection Board (may also affect Main Board ADC/DAC analog interface)
 * Analog baseband signal loop-back option
 * Analog RF signal loopback option (might be trivial)

= Misc = 

 * May have a microphone and a speaker (footprint)
