= IGLOO project =

___Note: an IGLOO project is used first to exclude any generated cores including the MSS.___

== Step 1 - Created project ==

{{{
 component
 constraint
 coreconsole
 designer
 hdl
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1) // + a .sav file (ignored)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)
 stimulus
 synthesis
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1) // this directory is being ignored
-igloo-test.prjx (1)
}}}

== Step 2 - Added top-level VHD file ==

{{{
 component
 constraint
 coreconsole
 designer
+hdl
+-dummy_top.vhd (2)
+-dummy_top_tools.xml (2) // long XML file w/o relevant info (RG)
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)
 stimulus
 synthesis
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1)
-igloo-test.prjx (1)
}}}

== Step 3 - Run synthesis ==

{{{
 component
 constraint
 coreconsole
 designer
+hdl
+-dummy_top.vhd (2)
+-dummy_top_tools.xml (2)
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)
 stimulus
+synthesis (3)
+-dummy_top_sdc.sdc // Synplify generated constraint file (RG)
+-dummy_top.so // XML file reporting synthesis outcome
+-[synthesis results] // (RG)
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1)
-igloo-test.prjx (1)
}}}

 * Synthesis directory filled up with files (Assuming that its content  can be ignored)
 * Content of other directories unchanged
 * Project file updated, reflects synthesis result

== Step 4 - Run compile ==

{{{
 component
 constraint
 coreconsole
+designer
+-impl
 +-dummy_top.adb // binary file; compilation result
 +-dummy_top.ide_des
 +-dummy_top.tcl // seems to be an init script for designer
                 // imports source /synthesys/dummy_top.edn
                 // saves output as dummy_top.adb
 +-[log files]
+hdl
+-dummy_top.vhd (2)
+-dummy_top_tools.xml (2)
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)
 stimulus
+synthesis (3)
+-[synthesis results] // (RG)
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1)
-igloo-test.prjx (1)
}}}

 * /designer/impl directory populated
 * Project file reflects results and reference to outpus
 * Project file also includes references to .so and .sdc files (not added manually)

== Step 5 - Run Place & Route ==

 * /designer/impl directory filled up with more log files
 * /designer/impl/dummy_top.adb updated

== Step 6 - Created constraint file == 

{{{
 component
+constraint
+-dummy_top.pdc (6)
 coreconsole
+designer
+-impl
 +-[designer output files]
 +-[log files]
+hdl
+-dummy_top.vhd (2)
+-dummy_top_tools.xml (2)
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)
 stimulus
+synthesis (3)
+-[synthesis results]
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1)
-igloo-test.prjx (1)
}}}

 * Adding the constraint file seems to affect the project file only

== Step 7 - Adding a SmartDesign ==

__Note: A SmartDesign dummy_sd was simply added to the design, which was saved afterwards. (e.g. it wasn't made a top level element)

{{{
+component
++work
 ++dummy_sd
  +-dummy_sd.cxf (7) // XML format, might accompany the .sdb file, though it contains no explicit reference to it
  +-dummy_sd.sdb (7) // binary file, seems to be (RG) (!)
+constraint
+-dummy_top.pdc (6)
 coreconsole
+designer
+-impl
 +-[designer output files]
 +-[log files]
+hdl
+-dummy_top.vhd (2)
+-dummy_top_tools.xml (2)
 phy_synthesis
+simulation
+-modelsim.ini (1)
+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1) (7) // new XML entry <component name="dummy_sd::work"/>
+-dummy_sd_work.ixf (7) // XML file, seems to be the definition of "dummy_sd::work"
                        // contains reference path="../component/work/dummy_sd/dummy_sd.cxf"
 stimulus
+synthesis (3)
+-[synthesis results]
+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1)
-igloo-test.prjx (1) (7) // reference to component/work/dummy_sd/dummy_sd.cxf
                         // SmartDesign list item dummy_sd
}}}

 * Files showed up under component/work/dummy_sd and smartgen
 * Project file and smartgen/smartgen.aws updated
