= IGLOO project =

___Note: an IGLOO project is used first to exclude any generated cores including the MSS.___

== Step 1 - Created project ==

{{{

 designer

+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)

+viewdraw
+-[junk] (1) // this directory is being ignored
-igloo-test.prjx (1)

== Step 2 - Added top-level VHD file ==

{{{

+smartgen
+-smartgen.aws (1)

== Step 3 - Run synthesis ==

 * Synthesis directory filled up with files (Assuming that its content  can be ignored)
 * Content of other directories unchanged
 * Project file updated, reflects synthesis result

== Step 3 - Synthesis ==

{{{

+-impl
 +-dummy_top.adb // binary file; compilation result
 +-dummy_top.ide_des
 +-dummy_top.tcl // seems to be an init script for designer

 * /designer/impl directory populated
 * Project file reflects results and reference to outpus
 * Project file also includes references to .so and .sdc files (not added manually)
