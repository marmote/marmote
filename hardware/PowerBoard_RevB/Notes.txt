							  Change log (Rev B)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from Rev A to Rev B:

- The !CHRG pin of the LTC4085 is connected to a microcontroller GPIO (PB9)
  instead of an external LED (LED0)
- LED0 has been removed
- The !PWRGD pin of the LTC4361 is NOT connected to a microcontroller GPIO
  (PB9) anymore
- Power rail measurements have changed
	- Current on VSUP (individually) and on D3V3_STM is not measured anymore
	- Current and voltage on VSUP_R (source of all rails) is measured instead
	- The current sense - ADC connections have been completely reorganized
- The LTC2942-1 battery gauge !AL/CC pin is connected to GPIO PB4 instead of PB5
- The 64-pin mezzanine connector has been replaced with a 84-pin one
- The mezzanine connector pinous has been reorganized
	- The PB5 GPIO line on the connector has been replaced with PB4 (with SMBus alter functionality)
- JTAG DNP resistors have been removed, only SWD is available
- Added pull-up resistor to the USBDP line (still not the best solution)
- Reset jumper has been replaced with a push button
- BOOT0 selector jumper has been replaced with a slide switch

Current Senses
--------------

  * Digital 3.3V STM (D3V3_STM from XC6220)
  * Digital 3.3V (D3V3 from XC6220')
  * Digital 1.5V (D1V5 from XC9236)
  * Analog 3.3V (A3V3 from XC6220' through bead)
  * Analog 1.5V (A1V5 from XC9236 through bead)
  * Highest available source (VSUP)
    - only the current portion flowing through the West bridge is measured (that
	  is it does not include include local board consumption)
  * BAT
    - Measured with battery gas gauge LTC2942-2
    - R_SENSE = 50 mohm seems to be adequate (see notes)
      - 1000 mA maximum charge/discharge current
      - using large capacity (4000-6000 mAh) battery register overflow is expected
        (to be handled from SW in the microcontroller)
    -50 mohm R_SENSE is available as INTERNAL resistor in LTC2942-2

Notes
-----

  * The current of the power lines from the USB (VBUS) and the wall adapter
    (WALL) is not monitored

  * The voltage of VSUP is not measured, thus the power consumption on this
    line can only be estimated when it is operated from a battery (battery
    gas gauge voltage measurement)

  * All current monitors use AGND as reference except for the battery line,
    which uses DGND

  * All power rails are monitored with MAX9938 (G=50 V/V) current sense
    amplifier except for the one on the battery line

  * All current monitors use R_SENSE = 50 mohm

    - I_MAX = 1000 mA, U_REF = 3.3V (1.5V), G = 50 V/V, U_OUT,MAX = 3V
    - U_R, SENSE = R_SENSE x I_MAX < U_OUT,MAX / G

		   R_SENSE < 60 mohm
		   -----------------
		   R_SENSE = 50 mohm



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Microcontroller
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * STM32F102B ARM Cortex-M3 based microcontroller

  * Power sources

    - D3V3_STM always on digital 3.3V

  * Clock sources

    - 16 MHz external crystal (HSE, USB)
	- 32.768 kHz external crystal (LSE, not pupulated by default)

  * Reset signal

    - External reset via jumper

  * Programmer interfaces

	- SWD:  primary progammer interface, w/ SWTRACE (Programmer connector)
	- JTAG: secondary programmer interface, TDI and RESET are not connected to
	  the programmer header by default
	- USB:  programming is NOT supported through the USB connector

	- SmartFusion: the microcontroller should be capable of programming the SmartFusion
	  MSS and FPGA fabric via emulating JTAG on its GPIO pins (West bridge)

  * Communication interfaces

    - I2C1: SmartFusion board
    - I2C2: LTC2942 (1100100)
    - SPI1: SmartFusion Board
    - SPI2: microSD card

  * GPIO pin requests

    Note: '+' before the pin name means it is connected (available),
	      '-' means the IC pin is not connected (unavailable) to the
		  microcontroller

	- LTC4361
	  + #PWRGD
	  - ON

	- LTC4085
