TODO for BeaverBoard rev B
==========================

	* AGND, GND, 6V, VUSB to measurement pins for easier probing
	* Connect LDAC to FPGA
	* Label RX/TX connectors
	* Adjust screw positions
	* Component labels not next to their components should be more obviously placed (in a box?) on silk screen
	* USRP daughter board EEPROM I2C address on silk screen 
	* On schematic group or mark signals at connector, e.g. the 4 ADC and 3 DAC lines
	* On schematic label USRP DB RX/TX connector
	* Labels misaligned when printing to PDF
